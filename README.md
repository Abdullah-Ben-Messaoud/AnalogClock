# AnalogClock

This is a simple analog clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## Description

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the clock, including the dial, markings, and hands (hour, minute, and second).  
- **CSS**: Styles the clock, positions the markings and hands, and ensures everything scales proportionally with the clock size.  
- **JavaScript**: Updates the hands every second so the clock shows the correct current time.  

The clock is fully responsive, and the hands move in real time.
